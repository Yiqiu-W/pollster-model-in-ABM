##### find the best strategy for the pollster to get as many interviews done as possible
##### modified model with probability of individal refusing the interview(still possible to take it the next time) and recommendation(the interviewed individuals show others they met the direction of the pollster)

##### In the original model, the best strategy is to stand still and the success rate is about 55%. Choosing the drunkard walking mode gives a success rate of about 52%. Choosing other three walking modes gives similar success rates which are slightly lower than 50%. After modifying the model, standing still is still the most successful strategy but the success rate increases dramatically and reached about 90%. The success rate of choosing drunkard also increased and reached around 60%. But the success rates of choosing the other three walking modes became less than 25%.

##### In the modified model, although people could refuse the interview, they might take the interview the next time. Also, people who have been interviewed would "guide" people who are not interviewed to the pollster. So the results from the modified model make sense because if the pollster just stand still, it would be easier for potential interviewees to find the pollster. Or the pollster could be running away from interviewing oppotunities.
